# Datathon-2024
Cal's 6th Annual Datathon for Social Good (2024 1st place)

My team and I were tasked with developig a plan to restructure the student assignment price in the San Francisco Union School District (SFUSD) while ensuring raical diversity and comparable income distributions. We also had to decide which school programs to shut down and which to expand (and by how much). Utilizing geopandas, PuLP's linear optimization, and machine learning, we reduced district block income disparities to a median difference of just $2353, a variance of just 63 students, and comparable racial diversity, propelling us to win 1st place!
